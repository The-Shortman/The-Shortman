## About me

I'm an amateur programmer and an avid computer hardware enthusiast from the UK.

### In Academia

I am a Physics undergraduate at University, where I use Python to analyse data.

### At Home

I work on Minecraft modpacks in my free time for fun:
- [Create: Astral](https://github.com/Laskyyy/Create-Astral), for which I designed the main menu, refactored and standardised the codebase in mid-2025, and now continue to fix bugs and improve developer experience for the whole team.
- My own modpack, [Planets and Portals 3](https://github.com/The-Shortman/planets-and-portals-3), for which I am the sole programmer and designer.

I use JavaScript in KubeJS, work with Minecraft datapacks, and have used GitHub Actions to automatically build releases.

## How to reach me

You can find me frequently chatting in the Create: Astral [Discord server](https://discord.gg/StW3Q5K8dJ).
Apologies, but I do not have any socials and I don't accept Discord friend requests. Please only try to contact me if it is related to my Minecraft modpack projects.
